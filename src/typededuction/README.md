# Modern C++ Type Deduction Mechanisms

Type deduction allows the compiler to infer types automatically, making code more concise, expressive, and easier to maintain. 

From C++11 through C++20, the language has introduced a variety of type deduction capabilities.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of modern C++ type deduction. It also highlights best practices and rules to help developers use `auto`, `decltype`, and related features effectively.

Mastering type deduction is essential for writing clean, robust, and modern C++ code.
